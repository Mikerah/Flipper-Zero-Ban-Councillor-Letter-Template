# Flipper-Zero-Ban-Councillor-Letter-Template

The Federal Canadian government is proposing to ban Flipper Zero products due to its purported use as a tool for auto thefts. There isn't much evidence for this use case for the Flipper Zero product and banning it will have negative effects for STEM education and innovation in Canada.

This is a short letter template to send to your local councillor or other representative to ask for their support against the ban. 

-----------------------
Dear Councillor [Name],

I am writing to urgently address [the proposed ban on Flipper Zero products](https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2024/02/government-of-canada-hosts-national-summit-on-combatting-auto-theft.html?ref=blog.flipper.net), a decision that not only overlooks the tool’s educational value but also unfairly penalizes Canadian technology enthusiasts and STEM educators.

As a [Your Profession/Title] and a resident of [Your Location], I have witnessed the distressing rise in auto thefts. It’s commendable that our government is exploring solutions to this issue. However, the proposal to ban Flipper Zero is a misguided approach that fails to address the root causes of auto theft and instead stifles technological innovation and education.

Flipper Zero is more than just a gadget; it’s an integral tool for STEM education and innovation, fostering a deeper understanding of technology among hobbyists, students, and professionals alike. Banning it would not only impede our technological growth but also unjustly punish a community dedicated to legal and constructive use of technology.

I urge you to read Flipper Zero's comprehensive response, which clarifies misconceptions about the device and its inability to aid in auto theft: [Flipper Zero's Response Article](https://blog.flipper.net/response-to-canadian-government/).

I hope you will consider the broader implications of this ban and lend your voice to prevent this hasty and counterproductive decision. Our community depends on informed leadership to guide us towards thoughtful and effective solutions.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Title/Position]
[Your Location]
